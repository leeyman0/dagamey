This was for a project at Towson University, I made a game portion of a website.
* Structure And Interpretation of dagamey
  dagamey follows a very simple architecture:
  - All asset (eg. audio, video, picture) files are in the ~./Assets~ folder
  - All code for the program of dagamey is in ~./dagamey.js~
  - A lesson is stored as an array of JSON that utilizes the ~question(qtype, qdata, qans)~ constructor function
    for each element.
  - Lessons are compiled into HTML by using the ~generate_lesson(lesson_data, div)~ function, where ~lesson_data~ is
    the array of JSON for the lesson, and ~div~ is the HTML element that one would like the lesson generated in.
  - ~index.html~ is a small program that utilizes dagamey. Try it for yourself!
  - To use this library, put ~<script src="/path/to/dagamey.js"></script>~ in your HTML somewhere. Write your driver
    code in an empty ~<script>~ tag below!
